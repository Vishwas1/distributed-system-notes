## Part III 

> We discuss systems that derive some datasets from other datasets.

- Derived data often occurs in heterogeneous systems: when there is no one database that can do everything well, applications need - to integrate several different databases, caches, indexes, and so on.
- Batch processing approach to derived data and we build upon it with stream processing in.
- we put everything together and discuss approaches for building reliable, scalable, and maintainable applications in the future.
