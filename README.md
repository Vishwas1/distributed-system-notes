# Notes on designing highly realiable, scalable and maintainable (RSM) systems

Repository is to learn Distributed Systems. This note have been prepared from the book **Designing Data-Intensive Applications** written by **Martin Kleppmann**. In my view this is an awesome book (specially for begineers) which convers a lots of basic concepts realted to building a highly scalable systems. You can download the book from [here](http://xfido.com/pdf/designing-data-intensive-applications.pdf) or else can purchase it from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.in/Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications-Reliable-Maintainable/dp/9352135245?tag=googinhydr18418-21&tag=googinkenshoo-21&ascsubtag=_k_EAIaIQobChMIr5fm-YuR5QIVQgwrCh28JARLEAYYASABEgKlX_D_BwE_k_&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIr5fm-YuR5QIVQgwrCh28JARLEAYYASABEgKlX_D_BwE) too.
