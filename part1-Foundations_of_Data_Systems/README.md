## Part I : Foundations of Data Systems

> We will discuss the fundamental ideas that underpin the design of dataintensive applications.

- Concepts reliability, scalability, and maintainability;
- how we need to think about them;
- How we can achieve them;
- we compare several different data models and query languages, and see how they are appropriate to different situations
- how databases arrange data on disk so that we can find it again efficiently.
- What are the formats for data encoding (serialization) and evolution of schemas over time.
